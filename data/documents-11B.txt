Further, this proliferation inhibition is accompanied by induction of neural-like expression and splicing patterns in cancer cells, suggesting that SRRM4 expression shifts the cell state away from proliferation and toward differentiation.

SEs, characterized as large clusters of enhancers with aberrant high levels of transcription factor binding, have been considered as key drivers of gene expression in controlling and maintaining cancer cell identity. In cancer cells, oncogenes acquire SEs and the cancer phenotype relies on these abnormal transcription programs driven by SEs, which leads to cancer cells often becoming addicted to the SEs-related transcription programs, including prostate cancer.', 'url': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299103'}
